# Sentry 

A moderation bot for [Code Long & Profit](https://discord.gg/qMJfVG5VhB).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the following contents:

```env
BOT_ID=""
BOT_TOKEN=""
BOT_PREFIX=""
```

4. Build the typescript files with `npm run build` or `yarn build`
5. Run the bot with `npm start` or `yarn start`

To get the bot token you must visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Then, create a bot user and copy the token. You can find the other bot information on this page as well.
